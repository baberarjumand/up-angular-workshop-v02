Bootstrap Layout

- container and container-fluid

- a row consists of 12 cols over which you layout your elements

- can have another row inside col

- can have another col inside row

- theoretically, you can nest lots of alternating rows and cols
	- bad practice, keep it as simple as possible

- cannot place a row inside a row, or a col inside a col

- mobile first layout approach
	- first design layout for mobile
	- then use breakpoint utilities for adjust layout on bigger screens
	
- bootstrap default breakpoints:
	- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/#grid-options
	
- responsive design basic example
